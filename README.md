- Walkwi Simulator Introduction
- Difference between Arduino, NodeMCU & Raspberry Pi
- Python (Basics)
- Pin Configuration of Sensors
- LED, DHT11 & PIR Sensor Connections with Arduino
- Installing Arduino IDE & Anaconda

### Guided By:
Training Instructor (Classroom-Based)

### 📘 Concepts Learned:
- Role & levels of IoT architecture
- How smart sensors/actuators function
- What makes a system “smart”
- Simulators are used to test virtual IoT connections
- Arduino Code: setup() runs once, loop() keeps reading sensors
- DHT11 reads humidity & temp, PIR detects motion
- Basic pin configuration & wiring logic

### 🔧 Tools / Platforms Used:
- Walkwi Simulator
- Arduino UNO
- Arduino IDE
- Anaconda (setup started)

###  Tasks Assigned:
- Code on simulator to read humidity & temperature using DHT11 + Arduino
- Install Anaconda
- Compare NodeMCU, Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards

###  Reflections:
Simulators helped me understand connections without hardware. Also started comparing microcontroller boards. Wiring and sensor logic is becoming more clear.
